  <article>  The Third Punic War (Latin: Tertium Bellum Punicum) (149â€“146 BC) was the third and last of
    the Punic Wars fought between the former Phoenician colony of Carthage and the Roman Republic. The
    Punic Wars were named because of the Roman name for Carthaginians: Punici, or Poenici.

            <p>This war was a much smaller engagement than the two previous Punic Wars and
              focused on Tunisia, mainly on the Siege of Carthage, which resulted in the
              complete destruction of the city, the annexation of all remaining Carthaginian
              territory by Rome, and the death or enslavement of the entire Carthaginian
              population. The Third Punic War ended Carthage's independent existence.</p>
