  <article>  The Punic Wars were a series of three wars fought between Rome and Carthage from 264 BC to
     146 BC. At the time, they were some of the largest wars that had ever taken place. The term Punic
     comes from the Latin word Punicus (or Poenicus), meaning "Carthaginian", with reference to the
     Carthaginians' Phoenician ancestry.

            <p>The First Punic War (264 to 241 BC) was the first of three wars fought between Ancient
              Carthage and the Roman Republic, the two great powers of the Western Mediterranean. For 23
              years, in the longest continuous conflict and greatest naval war of ancient times, the two
              powers struggled for supremacy, primarily on the Mediterranean island of Sicily and its
              surrounding waters, and also in North Africa.</p></section>

            <p>The Second Punic War, also referred to as The Hannibalic War and (by the Romans) the War
              Against Hannibal was a global war that lasted from 218 to 201 BC and involved great powers
              in the western and eastern Mediterranean. It was the second major war between Carthage and
              the Roman Republic and its allied Italic socii, with the participation of Greek polities and
               Numidian and Iberian forces on both sides.</p></section>

            <p>The Third Punic War (Latin: Tertium Bellum Punicum) (149â€“146 BC) was the third and last
              of the Punic Wars fought between the former Phoenician colony of Carthage and the Roman
              Republic. The Punic Wars were named because of the Roman name for Carthaginians: Punici, or
              Poenici.</p>
