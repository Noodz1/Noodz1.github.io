  <article>  The Second Punic War, also referred to as The Hannibalic War and (by the Romans) the War
    Against Hannibal was a global war that lasted from 218 to 201 BC and involved great powers in the
    western and eastern Mediterranean. It was the second major war between Carthage and the Roman Republic
    and its allied Italic socii, with the participation of Greek polities and Numidian and Iberian forces
     on both sides.

            <p>The Second Punic War is one of the deadliest human conflicts in ancient times. Regarded by
               ancient historians as the greatest war in history, waged with unparalleled resources, skill
               and hatred,[3]:21.1 it saw hundreds of thousands killed, some of the most lethal battles in
                military history, the destruction of cities and massacres and enslavements of civilian
                populations and prisoners of war by both sides.

The war began with the Carthaginian general Hannibal's conquest and destruction of the Roman-allied Iberian
 city of Saguntum in 219 BC, prompting a Roman declaration of war on Carthage in 218. Hannibal surprised
  the Romans by marching his army overland from Iberia to cross the Alps and invade Roman Italy, followed
  by his reinforcement by Gallic allies and crushing victories over Roman armies at Trebia river in 218 and
   on the shores of Lake Trasimene in 217. Moving to southern Italy in 216, Hannibal at Cannae annihilated
    the largest army the Romans had ever assembled, killing or capturing more than 67,000 Roman soldiers.
    After the death or imprisonment of 130,000 Roman troops in two years, 40% of Rome's Italian allies
    defected to Carthage, giving her control over most of southern Italy. Macedon and Syracuse joined the
    Carthaginian side after Cannae and the conflict spread to Greece and Sicily. The Carthaginian navy was
    built up in the early years of the war and from 215â€“210, the Carthaginian army and navy launched
    amphibious assaults to capture Roman Sicily and Sardinia but were ultimately repulsed.

Against Hannibal's skill on the battlefield, the Romans adopted the Fabian strategy - the avoidance of
battle against Hannibal and defeating his allies and the other Carthaginian generals instead. Roman armies
recaptured all of the great cities that had joined Carthage and defeated a Carthaginian attempt to
reinforce Hannibal at Metaurus in 207. Southern Italy was turned into a wasteland by the combatants, with
 hundreds of thousands of civilians killed or enslaved. In Iberia, which served as a major source of
 manpower for the Carthaginian army, a Roman expeditionary force under Publius Cornelius Scipio captured
 Carthago Nova, Carthage's capital city in Iberia, in 209, massacring and enslaving the inhabitants.
 Scipio's destruction of a Carthaginian army at Ilipa in 206 permanently ended Carthaginian rule in Iberia.
  He invaded Carthaginian Africa in 204, inflicting two severe defeats on Carthage and her allies at Utica
  and the Great Plains that compelled the Carthaginian senate to recall Hannibal's army from Italy.
  The final engagement between Scipio and Hannibal took place at Zama in Africa in 202 and resulted in
  Hannibal's defeat and the imposition of harsh peace conditions on Carthage (Carthaginian peace), which
  ceased to be a great power and became a Roman client state until its final destruction by the Romans in
  146 BC during the Third Punic War. The Second Punic War overthrew the established balance of power of
  the ancient world and Rome rose to become the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin for the next 600
   years.</p></section>
